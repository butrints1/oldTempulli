We strictly implement the decisions of government institutions and the IRU Academy in the field of traffic and transport, following closely the action plans which include preventive measures to help protect transporters.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to our drivers, we have food, medicine and essentials for life. The uninterrupted work of drivers in the supply chain is imperative and we are grateful to you for the commitment. As an immediate action, the IRU Academy has developed recommendations to ensure that all drivers are safe while performing their tasks.<\/p>\n<p>We submitted these recommendations for the protection of drivers during this pandemic to various Kosovo institutions, such as: the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Kosovo Security Force, Kosovo Police, Kosovo Chamber of Commerce, Chamber German Kosovar, Association of Kosovo Municipalities, Kosovo Transport Association, Kosovo Motorization Association, Municipality of Prishtina and media.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4261&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221; alignment=&#8221;center&#8221;][vc_column_text]\n<p style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>AMRKS ADVISES ON ROAD SAFETY DURING COVID 19<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Prishtine, 29 March 2020<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 has quickly become a great concern but also a top priority for every citizen and government in the world. Our priority yesterday, today, tomorrow and always is the safety of the citizens in general and the safety of movement in particular. The Kosovo Motoring Association AMRKS, pointed out that today every citizen should render maximum care during movement and respect the traffic rules and signs and current instructions in effect. As a result of this (lack of) responsibility, we must not burden hospitals and emergency services with the injured and victims of road traffic accidents, as they today face pandemics and are all focused on improving medical services to treat patients with corona virus. Consequently, in these new circumstances and in this emergency situation, AMRKS urges for additional caution from each potential participant on the road.<\/p>\n<p>The strongest message on road safety in this pandemic situation is to absolutely follow the advice of the National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo, and of other health and safety institutions, and the decisions of the government of the country.<\/p>\n<p>AMRKS, as an advocate for road safety and mobility, gives the following recommendations in this time of crisis:<\/p>\n<p>Stay home and only go out if you have essential needs. If you have to go out, walk safely keeping the social distance; if you are on a bike\/motorcycle, you should definitely use the helmet; if you are in a vehicle, you should drive with extra caution and use the seat belt, reduce the speed of driving, do not consume drinks and food while driving and do not use the mobile phone. You must be responsible for yourself and for the sake of others.<\/p>\n<p>AMRKS wishes you health and asks for caution from all citizens who are participants in traffic, with special emphasis on those are carrying out duties, those engaged in the transport industry and the supply chain, at this challenging time. Please always stay safe and stay informed.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1589839891185{padding-top: 10px !important;padding-right: 10px !important;padding-bottom: 10px !important;padding-left: 10px !important;background-color: #ffffff !important;border-radius: 10px !important;}&#8221;] Dear citizens, We ensure you that your personal information will remain confidential, and will be used only to ensure safety of your health by health professionals who aim to prevent and control the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus.
